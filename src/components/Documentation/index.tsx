              Ords are an experimental attempt to improve the formation of on-chain avatar
              communities. While projects such as {cryptopunksLink} have attempted to bootstrap
              digital community and identity, Ords attempt to bootstrap identity, community,
              governance, and a treasury that can be used by the community.

                Ords DAO utilizes a fork of {compoundGovLink} and is the main governing body of the
                Ords ecosystem. The Ords DAO treasury receives 100% of ETH proceeds from daily
                Ord auctions. Each Ord is an irrevocable member of Ords DAO and entitled to one
                vote in all governance matters. Ord votes are non-transferable (if you sell your
                Ord the vote goes with it) but delegatable, which means you can assign your vote to
                someone else as long as you own your Ord.

                  The proposal veto right was initially envisioned as a temporary solution to the
                  problem of ‘51% attacks’ on the Ords DAO treasury. While Ordders initially
                  believed that a healthy distribution of Ords would be sufficient protection for
                  the DAO, a more complete understanding of the incentives and risks has led to
                  general consensus within the Ordders, the Ords Foundation, and the wider
                  community that a more robust game-theoretic solution should be implemented before
                  the right is removed.

              <p>
                <Trans>
                  The Ords community has undertaken a preliminary exploration of proposal veto
                  alternatives (‘rage quit’ etc.), but it is now clear that this is a difficult
                  problem that will require significantly more research, development and testing
                  before a satisfactory solution can be implemented.

              <p>
                <Trans>
                  Consequently, the Ords Foundation anticipates being the steward of the veto power
                  until Ords DAO is ready to implement an alternative, and therefore wishes to
                  clarify the conditions under which it would exercise this power.

              <p>
                <Trans>
                  The Ords Foundation considers the veto an emergency power that should not be
                  exercised in the normal course of business. The Ords Foundation will veto
                  proposals that introduce non-trivial legal or existential risks to the Ords DAO
                  or the Ords Foundation, including (but not necessarily limited to) proposals
                  that:

              <p>
                <Trans>
                  There are unfortunately no algorithmic solutions for making these determinations
                  in advance (if there were, the veto would not be required), and proposals must be

                  Ords are stored directly on Ethereum and do not utilize pointers to other
                  networks such as IPFS. This is possible because Ord parts are compressed and
                  stored on-chain using a custom run-length encoding (RLE), which is a form of
                  lossless compression.

                  The compressed parts are efficiently converted into a single base64 encoded SVG
                  image on-chain. To accomplish this, each part is decoded into an intermediate
                  format before being converted into a series of SVG rects using batched, on-chain
                  string concatenation. Once the entire SVG has been generated, it is base64
                  encoded.

                  The Ord Seeder contract is used to determine Ord traits during the minting

                  algorithm upgrades. Additionally, it can be locked by the Ords DAO to prevent any
                  future updates. Currently, Ord traits are determined using pseudo-random number
                  generation:

                  Because 100% of Ord auction proceeds are sent to Ords DAO, Ordders have chosen
